          TDCheck is a small utility to verify the integrity of a  TeleDisk
          .TDO file.   It reports the type and density of the drive used to
          make the image, the compression method,  and the area copied from
          the diskette.

          TDCheck is run as a DOS command-line utility;  the command syntax
          is:

                         TDCheck file...

          where file is the name of one or more TeleDisk image files.   The
          .TD0 extension need not be specified and the file name(s) can con-
          tain the wildcard characters '*' and '?'.   Here is an example of
          a TDCheck session:
